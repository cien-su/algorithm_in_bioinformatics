# Algorithm in Bioinformatics
> To realize algorithm using Python when studying bioinformatics principle
## Preface
In bioinformatics principle, Numerous algorithms are displayed. Can we realize them through coding?

Yes!

This repository provides many algorithms occurred in bioinformatics using Python. All codes are written by the author based on his own understanding. Corrections and update are welcomed!

In this repository, all algorithms are separated into different folders (keep updating): 

- Sequence Match
- ...

The explanation file of each algorithm is placed in the corresponding folders. If you have any questions, feel free to contact with me.
